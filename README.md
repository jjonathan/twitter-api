# An twitterish application for studying purposes

## Technologies
- Java
- AWS
- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)

## Concept
The idea is to make an API for tweets, using AWS Lambda and Java to test my Java skills and how lambda works with Java language.
I use the Serverless framework to help me deploying and have Infra as Code easily.

## APIs

- POST /tweet - Create a new tweet
- GET /tweet - List all tweets

## Progress

### TODOs
- POST /tweet
- GET /tweet
