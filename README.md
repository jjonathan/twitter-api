# An twitterish application for studying purposes

## Technologies
- Java
- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)

## Concept
The idea is to make an API for tweets, using AWS Lambda and Java to test my Java skills and how lambda works with Java language.
I use the Serverless framework to help me deploying and have Infra as Code easily.
